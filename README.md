# SynGenLib

**SynGenLib** is an object-oriented Python library that establishes a framework for defining dataclasses of synchronous generators and their respective step-up transformers. Using these dataclasses, one can define objects that helps calculate the power losses of the synchronous machine, according to the method presented in [1]. Additionally, there are functionalities for defining generator capability diagrams according to the system of equations established in [2], with the purpose to calculate reactive power limits.

## Directory organization

Explain how the code and folders/directories are structured. For example if it is object oriented, which is the main file and which are the supporting utilities.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
